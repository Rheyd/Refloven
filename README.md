# Refloven

this projects aims to be a low cost and customisable reflow oven board, i inspired this in the job made by @rocketscream reflow oven shield with some additional hardware so it can have more I/O pins avaliable and also usb so there's need of external programmer.

currently working to fix some problems, v2 is actually really stable and works fine. have fun and as a side note, use the v1 to make the v2 got it ? (like a 3d printer )

v1 is the easies one to build, all by hand and some extra wire.

v2 is a little more complicated to, but if you sucessfully assembled v1 and tested it you have everything on your side. it works either with 328p or 328pb only difference is how to program it and the mapping of the i/o
